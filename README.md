### Why doesn't the integer change after the method call?
- The instructions specifically said to print the integer within the method and never mentioned returning anything.
- Additionally, even if I did return something, the code that produces the output in the "main" function does not update its variable using hte output of the function in any capacity. It calls it and does nothing else with it.

### Why does the array change after the method call?
- The array changes because I used a for loop that creates a new table and stores double the value of each value in the original array and returned the new array.
- The original code in the "main" function actually did not update its local "arr" variable, so I added it manually

### What happens when you try to access y outside the loop?
- The console says "y cannot be resolved to a variable."
